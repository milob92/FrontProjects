 <center><h1>There's a bit of Tina in all of us</h1></center>
 <p class="quote">Hi boys. I'm Tina. Dad, I need you to drop everything and shave my legs. If I drunk text you and you're asleep, don't text me in the morningâ€¦that ship has sailed. You had me at horses, but then you lost me at corpses. Sausage leather belts. Just when I think I'm out, those cheeks pull me right back in. My bra's chafing me. Ugg, my heart just pooped its pants. I can't tell where your back ends and your butt begins. Is it possible to be in love with 25 people at once? Your ass is grass and I'm gonna mow it. So I think I'm being attacked by zombies and I start screaming, 'Do you wanna make out?' And I make out with it. Just when I think I'm out, those cheeks pull me right back in. I could go to jail, or hell, or jail-hell. My bra's chafing me.
 </p>
 <p>I'm gonna write the most erotic, graphic, freakiest friend fiction ever. Ugg, my heart just pooped its pants. Dad, you're the best pimp a girl could ever have. There is one place I like to go. The boys' locker room. You can only see up to their ankles. Chad the Zombie touched the butt of that girl with the frosted hair from my art class. I think her name is Kristi. Sausage leather belts. My crotch is itchy. It includes material that may not be suitable for all ages. I guess she doesn't like wearing clothes. I need to find a boy with a turtle bite on his finger. He did? That's the sleaziest, sneakiest, most romantic thing anyone's ever done to me. My crotch is itchy. And I'm gonna read it to the whole school myself. The second time hurt the most.

<p class="quote">You're right. I'm a firestarter and a jinx. I'm going to destroy this whole family. C'mon Dad, just let me bite down on the bean. Tina reached towards Jimmy Junior's butt: 'Your lips say no but your butt says yes.' Chad the Zombie touched the butt of that girl with the frosted hair from my art class. I think her name is Kristi. I'm a smart, strong, sensual woman. She grabbed Jimmy Jr's butt and changed the world. If I were a hamburger you'd come and watch! Ugg, my heart just pooped its pants. Do you think horses get songs stuck in their heads? Everyone touched each other's butts, and it was great. Jimmy Jr. had a chance to ride the Tina truck, but now it's headed straight for Joshville. Toot-toot. Ugg, my heart just pooped its pants. I thought I saw a baby bump. I'm no hero. I just put my bra on one boob at a time.

<p>Hi boys. I'm Tina. There is one place I like to go. The boys' locker room. You can only see up to their ankles. Your ass is grass and I'm gonna mow it. Drop the towel. Dad, you're the best pimp a girl could ever have. uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh Put it on a t-shirt, Jimmy Jr, I don't want to hear it. This is like watching two monkeys at the puberty zoo. I'm no hero. I just put my bra on one boob at a time. If we see any mermaids, I'm gonna ask them where their merginas are. I'm a smart, strong, sensual woman. The second time hurt the most. I know how the shark thinks. It's confused. It doesn't know why we want to kill it. It just wants to go home. It includes material that may not be suitable for all ages. I'm gonna write the most erotic, graphic, freakiest friend fiction ever.

<center><h1>"Butt..."</h1></center>
<p class="quote">Dad, if you believe you're beautiful, you will be. I did. Butts. I'm out of control. He did? That's the sleaziest, sneakiest, most romantic thing anyone's ever done to me. I could go to jail, or hell, or jail-hell. My hearttttttttt. Let's raise our glasses! Here's a bunch of numbers. They may look random but they're my phone number. Ugg, my heart just pooped its pants. Butts. Gene, you saved us. I owe you my life. I didn't know our county was bi. Good for us. And I'm gonna read it to the whole school myself. Everything I know to be true just went out the window.</p>

<p>Not if you're a fish. Hey, you don't want to mess with my sister. She'll wear down your self esteem over a period of years. Please don't tell Mom and Dad. Now my rash smells like bacon. But it doesn't itch anymore. Dr. Yap, once I was into you, but after seeing you torture my father, I think we should just be friends with dental benefits. Sometimes with Jimmy Jr, I don't know what to say. But now I don't know what not to say and it's like okay guys, who can get to my mouth first? Chad the Zombie touched the butt of that girl with the frosted hair from my art class. I think her name is Kristi. Suddenly, Tina Belcher appeared in the doorway. She knew what she had to do. Hey Jimmy Jr. Did you see those two squirrels fighting in the courtyard? I'll wave at you every day. Your body. I had no idea there was so much butt touching in baseball. Dr. Yap, once I was into you, but after seeing you torture my father, I think we should just be friends with dental benefits. Your ass is grass and I'm gonna mow it.
